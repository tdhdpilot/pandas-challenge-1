## Module 4 Challenge

For this challenge we utilized a dataset from a fictional e-commerce company, giving us opportunities to explore and analyze data to address real-world business questions.

- We used code to identify top customers and popular product categories.
- Part of creating a solid understanding these top clients, we also examined data series and worked through transformation exercises to make the datasets more readable and understandable.
- Commands and process used:
  - Exploring the data - df.head(), df.columns, df.describe(), .value_counts(), .nlargest(3),.tolist(), .sum
  - Transforming the data utilized create columns, create shipping calculators, define outputs that brought together math and visualizations for readability.
  - Confirmation of work to validate totals
  - Identify Top Clients statistics to clean and organize data with - .sum(),.round(2), .items(),.isin(),.groupby(),.sort_values(),.rename()
  - Summarize and format the results outputs - ascending, .sort_values(),.map()
